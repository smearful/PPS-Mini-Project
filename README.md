# PPS-Mini-Project

Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the most played 2D games ever. 2 players can play this game. The game starts when a player places either a ‘X’ or an ‘O’ in a 3 x 3 grid. The goal 
of this game is to have three of your characters (‘X’ or ‘O’) placed consecutively 3 times in the grid either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

This simple game can be made using the  simple and easy to use C programming language. The code mostly uses only simple printf, scanf and conditional statements along with arrays, with little arithmetic. The game follows easy logic for the most part, and very few bits are tricky to achieve.
